# WebhookShowcaseBot
Copies messages from a showcase channel to a discussion channel

### In your server
If anyone or any bot reacts to a message before it gets sent in the discussion channel it may not send the embed. This only really becomes an issue if you have a bot auto-react to messages send in the showcase channel.
